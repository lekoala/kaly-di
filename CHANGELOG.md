## Unreleased

### Changed (composition contract)

Service definitions are additive; the only intentional replacement is `rebind()`.

```text
Before:
set() / bind() / merge() could silently replace service definitions.

Now:
service definitions are additive;
duplicate ownership fails fast;
rebind() is the only intentional replacement operation.
```

- `set()` and `bind()` now throw a `LogicException` when the id is already defined.
- `merge()` is additive and atomic: any service-id collision fails before any
  mutation, even when both sides declare the exact same value.
- `rebind($id, $value)` deliberately replaces an existing definition, and fails if
  the id does not exist. Parameters and callbacks keep their previous merge
  semantics.
- `rebind()` accepts an optional `expected` precondition, turning a replacement
  into a compare-and-swap: the id must still be defined exactly (strict identity)
  as assumed, otherwise the call fails. This guards tests, demos and variants
  against stale overrides.

See [docs/definitions.md](./docs/definitions.md) for details.
